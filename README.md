## Instructrions: Possible Error you may encounter 
Scene path in Unity 
Assets/Scenes/
 
To run the prototype, you need to simply press play for the scenes under assets for pen-scene and controller-scene

For the pen scene, the pen may think it is docked so make sure pen is not docked and stationary it is an error that occurs on a rare occasion but if it happens, try again; it will work.
